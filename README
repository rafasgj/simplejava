Simple Java
===========

The main goal of this project is to develop a programming framework to
aid teaching object oriented programming using the Java Programming
Language.

By using this framework, the number of concepts needed to be presented
to the student is reduced, and he can focus on the usage and design of
objects. For example, one need not need to know what a 'static' or
'class' method is, or what are arguments, or what is an array, since
there's no need to  write a 'main()' method for the program to work.
The program entry point is an instance method, with no parameters,
which is much easier to explain to a beginner programmer.

For command line programs, the framework provide simpler behavior, by
no using the standard Java streams, but providing a Console class that
has the apropriate methods for reading data (String, integers and float
point) from the standard input stream, and methods for printing on the
standard output stream.

Also, there is provision for event based and graphic applications, that
work similar to the [Arduino] board, where the student needs to
implement the _setup_ and _loop_ methods.

This project is in its early stages of development, and is being used
with undergraduate students on their second programming class to review
programming logic and teach object oriented concepts.

To use the framework, you'll need a Java Virtual Machine compatible
with Java 8.

The class documentation can be generated from the source code using the
javadoc tool, and if you have it installed the shell script found at
**scripts/generate_docs.sh** can be used to create the files under the
**doc** directory. Open the index.html file on that directory to access
the documentation. These documents can also be found online at
[http://extra/simplejava/index.html].
