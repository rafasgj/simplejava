Simple Java
===========

This project is a small framework to aid in teaching object oriented 
programming using the Java programming language.

The main objective is to reduce the number of concepts that need to 
be understood in order to write Java programs. For example, one need 
not need to know what a 'static method' is since there's no need to 
write a 'main()' method for the program to work.

This is in an early stages of development, and sugestions, bug fixes, 
and critique is very much appreciated.
